              <p>In this modern day and age, the very concept of technology is something heavily relied upon in order to ensure the feasibility of navigation along the internet. My name is Aditi Bongu, and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin highschool. Based upon my interest of how technology is always changing, my personal career goals as of right now involve becoming a software engineer once I have completed college. The main reason for this is because I take a great interest in the field of technology; there are multiple aspects to it and it is used in almost every other field today. For instance, the medical field is heavily dependent on technology in order to get results of patients. Similarly, other fields such as law also include the use of technology in order to produce proper evidence and results. Since it can be used in so many ways, it is of interest to me and something that I look forward to being involved with in the future. </p>
              <br>
              <p>As an individual, I am very collected, organized, and aware of what I want and how to get it. I organize things very well, and manage my time in order to make sure that the tasks at hand are able to be finished quickly, and efficiently. Whatever it is that I do, I put effort into it and make sure that the quality of that work is the highest that it can be. As an ambitious person, I always strive to go out of my way in order to explore and try new possibilities towards different things, and expirement with different ways to approach a problem as well. Currently, I have a job at Kumon, and have been volunteering at a Jewish senior center called The Reutlinger. Both of these places require a person to be patient, and hardworking. At Kumon, I have learned to manage my time well, and to be patient while assisting kids with their work and any questions they have. At the senior center, I have learned how to properly help and take care of someone when assistence is something that they need in order to survive. Both of these places have also taught me to be responsible, and caring towards people as well.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In eighth grade, I was a project manager for a program called CJSF, also known as the California Junior Scholarship Federation. This program has taught me many of my leadership skills that are needed for someone to be able to lead a group of peers. In addition, it has given me the knowledge needed to do the best that I can in the highschool version of this program (CSF), which is the California Scholarship Federation. This program has taught me to be caring and give back to the community. I am also part of a club called Dublin Afsana, which revolves around competitive dancing. Dancing has helped me, because it has taught me confidence, hard work, and most importantly, dedication. These skills which I have picked up, are extremely important to my education, because without hard work and dedication, I would not be able to get very far in life, and dancing has taught me that.</p>
              <br>
              <p>If there is one thing that should be taken from reading this portfolio, it is that education is something that is really important to me, and something I take great pride in for having the privilege of being educated. I constantly work hard, and try to become a better person in doing so. In addition, extracurriculars are also a very important aspect of my life as well. It is important to me that I am part of clubs, as it is the best way for me to show appreciation towards my community and give back to it. Finally, being involved with Afsana has given me a direct pathway to being able to represent my culture, and keep my dedication towards where I am from along with it. I now invite you to explore my website a little bit more, in order to find a few more things out about me, such as projects I have done, more about my work experience, and other things as well.
